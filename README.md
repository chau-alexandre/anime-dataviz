# Anime Data Visualization

Animes have become a major source of digital entertainment, often narrating stories in beautiful or dreadful fantastical universes. Like with many works of fiction, one can escape to a different world, empathize with charismatic characters, discover a foreign culture or simply appreciate the art itself. They have grown exponentially in popularity over the years, in particular with Western audiences. The result is a rich byproduct of human creativity, globalization and commercialism.

In this context, we attempt to bring insightful visualizations about the raw numbers obtained from these works of art that we love, but also the people behind their creation. We want to showcase what makes them so unique, and bring forward the artists and companies that produce them. We showcase all animes registered on MyAnimeList from 1917 to 2018, their diversity through their genre classification, and detailed information about the studios and "seiyuus", the voice actors of the industry. Furthermore, we focus on an interactive, elegant and playful user experience so that our visualizations are not only informative, but also aesthetically pleasing.

### Problem statement

With our data visualization, we aim at answering the following questions:

- How has anime evolved from its earliest years in 1917 until now? How did the number of produced animes increase through time? Is the average number of episodes per anime title now greater or smaller?

- How do we categorize anime? How are anime titles distributed across genres? What are the most popular and most represented genres?

- What are the most popular studios? Which genres are the most prevalent for each of them and how are the works rated by their audience?

- What are the most popular voice actors, for each language? How does the "seiyuu" social connections network look like?

### Final result

The website can be visited with any modern web browser. For the possible best experience, we recommend the following:

- Use Mozilla Firefox (76.0.1 at the time of writing) for best performance. For more information about brower (in-)compatibility, see our [Github issues](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-worldwideweebz/issues?q=).
- Clear your browser cache, for instance by force-reloading all files and assets on the website by pressing Ctrl + F5 or following [these instructions](https://clear-my-cache.com/).
- Use a desktop device (avoid mobile devices with small screen resolutions).
- Use a 1920x1080 maximized window. Entering fullscreen mode provides an even better display and immersion.
- You can refresh the homepage to see more animated backgrounds (they are selected at random).
