Visualization about anime informations

## Datasets

1) [MyAnimeList Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist): a sizeable collection of data from all animes registered on MyAnimeList and its users

2) [Anime Recommendations Database](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database): user scores from MyAnimeList

3) [Crunchyroll Animes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/filipefilardi/crunchyroll-anime-ratings): user scores from Crunchyroll

## Problematic

- What am I trying to show with my visualization? 

    Everweebthing.

- Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

## Related work

- What others have already done with the data?

    - [anime.plus](https://anime.plus/) (aka MALGraph) allows a user to aggregate statistics such as average score, rating distribution over time, watch time per month, score per year, pie charts over genres and recommendations. However, the data is per user only.

    - [Paper on anime vizualisations.](https://www.academia.edu/5210657/AniMap_An_Interactive_Visualization_Supporting_Serendipitous_Discovery_of_Information_about_Anime) However, it is only a research paper and no implementation was done on the subject.

    - [Fandom Vizualisation](https://bunnyadvocate.tumblr.com/post/171165531592/mapping-the-anime-fandom), which contains various vizualisations about anime's fandom.

    - [Story of Anime](https://www.kaggle.com/fatihbilgin/story-of-anime), uses [MyAnimeList Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist), contains a lot of data exploration and visualizations. We believe we can showcase even more appealing visualizations

- Why is your approach original?
  

- What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
