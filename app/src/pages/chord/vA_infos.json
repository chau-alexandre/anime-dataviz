"According to the Anime News Network, as of December 2008, Koyasu is the most prolific seiy\u016b in Japan with voice acting roles in 365 anime series. He is also part of the seiy\u016b quartet Weiss consisting of Weiss Kreuz voice castmates Shinichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki, and Yuuki Hiro. He used to work for Production Baobab but is now the head of T's Factory, a seiyuu company he founded in 1998.\\n\\n\r\nKoyasu is known for his deep, smooth voice, which often lands him in roles that are either villains or lonely bish\u014dnen. Recently, though (as in the cases of Mitsurugi Hanagata from Saber Marionette J, Ryo Kuroyanagi from Yakitate!! Japan, Bobobo-Bo-Bobobo, and Kei Itoshiki from Zoku Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei) he has been voicing more and more lively/humorous characters. According to Hisaya Nakajo, the mangaka of the series Hana-Kimi, the character of Masao Himejima was designed with Koyasu's voice in mind; the seiy\u016b ended up voicing this character in the series' drama CDs.\\n\\n\r\nKoyasu is also the creator of the Wei\u00df series, and has authored the manga Wei\u00df Side B. In creating Wei\u00df Kreuz, Koyasu was inspired by an old Japanese series called Sure Death.\\n\\n\r\nKoyasu often voices under the pseudonym Hayato Jumonji, especially in H anime.\\n\\n\r\nHe also narrates promotional videos and pre-flight safety videos for StarFlyer.\\n\\n\r\nBlood type: A\\n\r\nHeight: 175 cm\\n\r\nWeight: 60 kg\\n\r\nBust-Waist-Hip: 83-65-93 cm
